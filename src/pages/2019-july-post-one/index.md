My relationship with God. Out of all the relationships I have, this is the most important. I believe it's important to assess my standing before God, and to ask what I'm doing to please Him and what I'm currently doing that is not pleasing to Him. 

Here are 4 suggestions that I both need to work on and that I would like to share with you to strengthen your relationship with God. 

1. Be Genuine & Sincere

The Lord wants me to be genuine and sincere with Him as I pray. To share with Him how I'm really feeling inside, my struggles, my wants, etc.

2. Spend Time with the Lord

Like any relationship, I feel that spending quality time with the Lord will strengthen my relationship with Him. Conversations, activities, being vulnerable, serving, ability to connect with Him are all ways I can deepen my relationship with God. 

I think of one of my good buddies Matthew Hepworth. We were vulnerable with eachtother, would talk with each other, listen and feel understood by eachtoher, attend institute with eachother, served one another (mainly him giving me haircutts, adive, etc), play basketball with one another, joke with one another, compliment and admire one another, be beloved by one another, taking an interest in eachothers lives. 

3. Learning about God

through studying the scriptures helps me learn about His charachter and dealings with His children who once lived upon this earth. This also helps me have faith in Him that He can do for me, what He did for His children -- deliver from bondage, strengthen, nourish, prepare a way to keep His commandments, etc.
